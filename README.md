## Review

The task may sound simple at first glance, but creating a solution for arbitrary discounts would be quite interesting and challenging.

Of course I would do some research on developing such a ruleset that will be maintanable and expandable, but I've tried to stick to the expected duration and cobbled together something quick that does the job. For the same reason I've only created a small frontend-only app, without the REST endpoints to list or update the basket in a backend.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
